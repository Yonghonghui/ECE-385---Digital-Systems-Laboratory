UIUC ECE 385 Digital Systems Laboratory -- Spring 2024

Design, build, and test digital systems using transistor-transistor logic (TTL), SystemVerilog, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Topics include combinational and sequential logic, storage elements, input/output and display, timing analysis, design tradeoffs, synchronous and asynchronous design methods, datapath and controller, microprocessor design, software/hardware co-design, and system-on-a-chip(SOC). 

Topics:
Combinational logic circuits
Storage elements
Hazards and race conditions
Circuit characteristics (fanout, delays, etc.)
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
Combinational networks (adders, multiplexes, etc.) in SystemVerilog
Sequential networks (counters, shift registers, etc.) in SystemVerilog
Synchronous state machines
Static timing analysis, clock domains, metastability, and synchronization
Logic simulation and testbenches
Microprocessors and system on chip
Project using a microprocessor and system on chip concepts

Final Project: “Crazy Arcade”
